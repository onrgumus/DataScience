# Movieport Data Science Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project related to Movieport, a movie rating platform. In this project, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the Movieport dataset using the Python programming language and various data science libraries, primarily NumPy.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this data science project were as follows:

1. **Data Import**: We began by importing the Movieport dataset into a NumPy array.

2. **Data Exploration**: We explored the dataset to understand its structure, dimensions, and basic statistics.

3. **Data Cleaning**: We addressed missing values and performed data cleaning as necessary.

4. **Data Analysis**: Using NumPy, we calculated key statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation of movie ratings.

5. **Data Visualization**: We visualized the distribution of movie ratings using Matplotlib.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading the project's README file.

## Getting Started

If you would like to replicate or extend our analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for a step-by-step walkthrough of our analysis.
